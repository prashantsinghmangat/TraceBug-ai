# Chrome Extension

The TraceBug Chrome Extension lets non-developers (QA, PMs, support) capture bugs on **any website** — no code changes required.

## Install from Chrome Web Store

**[Install TraceBug](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fdemmibikigigkfjngclmdheeajhdgaj)** — one-click, works immediately.

## Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Supported | How to install |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Chrome  | Yes | Chrome Web Store |
| Edge    | Yes | Chrome Web Store (Edge runs Chrome extensions) |
| Brave   | Yes | Chrome Web Store |
| Opera   | Yes | Install "Install Chrome Extensions" add-on first, then Chrome Web Store |
| Firefox | No (different extension format) | Use the npm SDK: `npm install tracebug-sdk` |
| Safari  | No | Use the npm SDK |

## Install from Source (Developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prashantsinghmangat/tracebug-ai
cd tracebug-ai && npm install && npm run build
```

Then in `chrome://extensions/`:
1. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right)
2. Click **Load unpacked** → select `tracebug-extension/`

After code changes, run `npm run build` and click the **reload** icon on the TraceBug card.

## Usage

The extension popup has four actions:

| Action | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Capture Bug** (primary) | Starts a screen recording. A floating HUD shows the recording timer plus Pause, Mic, Screenshot, Draw, Blur (droplet icon — click an element to blur it, click again to unblur; captured into the recording), and Stop. |
| **Screenshot** | One-shot capture of the current viewport. Opens the ticket modal directly with the screenshot attached. |
| **View tickets** | Opens the dashboard panel on the current page. |
| **Inspect element** | DevTools-style inspection: hover shows a box-model highlight + computed-style tooltip; click attaches the element with its full style evidence (typography, colors as hex, box model, WCAG contrast) to the report as an `inspect` annotation. |

A 🎤 toggle in the popup adds microphone audio to the recording.

### ⚙ Record options

A collapsible panel below the Capture Bug button — options persist per user and flow popup → background → content script → `prepareRecording()`:

- **Capture** — record the **current tab** directly, or open Chrome's **desktop / window picker**.
- **Start delay** — none, **3 s**, or **5 s**, with an on-page 3-2-1 countdown overlay before recording rolls.
- **Blur before recording** — arms the element-level blur tool *before* capture starts: click elements to blur/unblur, then a floating **"● Start recording / Cancel"** bar (with **Undo** for the last blur) begins the recording with the redaction applied from the very first frame. Cancel clears the blurs.

### 🛡 Redaction rules

A collapsible panel for app-specific PII the built-in token patterns can't know about:

- **Sensitive field names** — comma/newline separated; matches form fields, storage keys, URL params, and JSON keys in captured data (`email` also covers `customer_email`).
- **Mask patterns** — one regex per line, case-insensitive, masked anywhere in captured text.

Rules are validated on save, synced across your browsers via `chrome.storage.sync`, and applied **live** — even to a page that's already recording. Same engine as the SDK's [`redact` config](configuration.md#redact); the content script hands them to the page-world SDK via `<html data-tb-redact>`.

### Capture flow

1. Click **Capture Bug**. No screen-share dialog appears: TraceBug records the console, the network, your clicks and an interactive **DOM replay**. (Optionally set a start delay or blur-first in **⚙ Record options**.)
2. Reproduce the bug. The HUD timer ticks; use **Draw** to highlight elements, or the droplet **Blur** button to click-blur sensitive elements (the element's text is masked in the DOM replay, and the blur is captured into the video if you're recording one).
3. Click **Stop** in the HUD.
4. The ticket modal opens with the replay, screenshots, console, network, and action chips all populated. Fill in title/description and export as HTML, GitHub issue, Jira ticket, Linear issue, or Slack message.

The capture follows you across pages. If it spans more than one, the DOM replay covers the page you finished on — the console, network and action timeline cover all of them.

#### Adding a screen recording

Turn on **Record video too** in **⚙ Record options** to add a screen recording. The choice is remembered, so you only do it once. Then:

1. Click **Capture Bug**. TraceBug shows one line explaining what's about to happen, then your browser's own "Choose what to share" dialog opens.
2. What you see there depends on **Capture** in Record options:
   - **Current tab** — the dialog is already set to the tab you're on; just confirm. (TraceBug asks the browser for this with `preferCurrentTab`.)
   - **Desktop / window (picker)** — the full tab/window/screen choice. Pick this tab unless you need a window or the whole screen.
3. Stop in the HUD, or with your browser's native "Stop sharing" button.

**macOS:** screen recording needs your browser ticked under **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording**, and the browser has to be quit and reopened afterwards. If it isn't, TraceBug says so and offers to capture without video instead — your browser reports an OS refusal the same way it reports you closing the dialog, so TraceBug reads the error text to tell them apart.

### Per-tab indicator

The toolbar icon shows a green **ON** badge while TraceBug is injected in the current tab. The badge clears automatically when you reload the page.

## How It Works

Manifest V3 architecture with four extension contexts:

```
Popup ──sendMessage──▶ Background (service worker)
                         │
                         ├─ chrome.scripting.executeScript ─▶ Content script (page tab)
                         │                                          │
                         │                                          └─ CustomEvent ─▶ SDK (page main world)
                         │
                         └─ chrome.offscreen.createDocument ─▶ Offscreen document (holds MediaRecorder)
```

**Why an offscreen document?** Service workers can't hold a `MediaStream`; they get killed when idle. The offscreen document keeps the recording alive across page reloads, navigation, and tab switches. It owns the `MediaRecorder` and persists the finalized recording to `chrome.storage.local` (proxied through the service worker because some Chrome builds don't expose `chrome.storage` to offscreen documents).

**Why proxy storage through the background?** `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` silently truncates responses larger than ~10 MB. A 30-second recording's base64 dataUrl is several MB, so we keep it out of IPC entirely: offscreen writes to storage, content-script reads from storage, page receives the bytes via a CustomEvent (in-process, no size limit).

## Permissions

| Permission | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| `activeTab` | Access the current tab when the popup is used |
| `storage` + `unlimitedStorage` | Persist the recording dataUrl (multi-MB) |
| `scripting` | Inject SDK into pages on demand |
| `tabs` | Detect navigation on the recording tab for HUD re-mount |
| `offscreen` | Create the offscreen document that holds `MediaRecorder` |
| `tabCapture` | Reserved (currently unused — recording uses `getDisplayMedia`) |
| `<all_urls>` | Work on any website |

All recording data stays in `chrome.storage.local` and the page's `localStorage`. Nothing leaves the browser.
